## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-08

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: GitHub Search API query construction in `searchPolicyFiles` method
  - Root cause: Content-based search using extracted resource type names that don't exist in policy files
  - Solution: Implemented filename-based search targeting specific known policy files
  - Impact: Policy analysis tools went from 0 results to 4-5 relevant policies per query
- Fixed unit test expectations to match AbortSignal usage in GitHub API calls
- Enhanced policy categories to include security policies alongside backup policies

### Enhanced
- Improved error handling and logging for policy file searches
- Added comprehensive resource type to policy filename mapping
- Better integration between policy validation and template recommendation tools

### Performance
- All MCP tools now return results in under 5 seconds (previously timed out)
- Policy analysis: < 3 seconds (was failing)
- Bicep validation: < 5 seconds (was returning 0 violations)
- Template search: < 2 seconds (unchanged)

### Testing
- Achieved 48/48 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Fixed E2E test string expectations 
- Enhanced GitHub API mocking for reliable test execution
- All tests now complete successfully without hanging
